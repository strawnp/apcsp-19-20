# echo!

## Prerequisites
Loops; Arrays

## Problem
echo is a Unix command, that, according to its manual page, "display[s] a line of text." For example:
```c
jharvard@run.cs50.net (~): echo This is CS50
This is CS50
```
Implement your own version of the echo command. You’ll want to loop through the user’s arguments and print them out one-by-one, adding a space between them. You may want to try the echo command on your Appliance first, to get a taste of how it works. Tip: Remember to error check for correct number of command line arguments!
## Distribution Code

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, string argv[])
{
    // TODO
    
    return 0;
}
```
